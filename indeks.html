        <p>Last December, I had an unforgettable trip with my classmates to Yogyakarta. It was a school trip organized to visit several historical places and enjoy the culture of the city.</p>
        <p>We departed from Semarang at 7 a.m. by bus. During the journey, we sang songs, played games, and enjoyed the beautiful scenery along the way. Our first destination was Borobudur Temple. It is one of the most famous Buddhist temples in the world. When we arrived, our guide explained the history of the temple and we took many pictures together.</p>
        <p>After visiting Borobudur, we continued our trip to Malioboro Street. It is a famous shopping street where we bought souvenirs, tasted local food, and interacted with local people. I bought some batik clothes and keychains for my family.</p>
        <p>We stayed in Yogyakarta for two days and one night. On the second day, we visited Prambanan Temple and the Sultanâ€™s Palace. Both places were amazing and rich in history. I learned a lot about Javanese culture and traditions.</p>
        <p>In the evening, we returned to Semarang. Although we were tired, we felt happy and grateful for the experience. It was one of the best trips I have ever had, and I hope to visit Yogyakarta again someday.</p>
